Notes for EDAC test:
=========================
1. During EDAC test, to avoid EDAC message lost, the value of ‘Correctable
   Error Threshold’ BIOS setup option should be selected as 'ALL'. If the
   'ALL' value isn't present in the selectable option value, you can do
   according to the tips on the right side when ‘Correctable Error Threshold’
   is selected, for example,
   you can disable ‘ADDDC Sparing’ to let 'ALL' option be present:
     Memory Configuration -> Memory RAS and Performance Configuration->ADDDC
     Sparing <Disabled>
     Memory Configuration -> Memory RAS and Performance Configuration->
     Correctable Error Threshold <All>

2. Disabling eMCA BIOS setup option before do EDAC test, otherwise, for one
   address, two similar EDAC information may be received, one of them includes
   incomplete machine check information on some platforms, such as invalid
   MCE bank information as below,
   "EDAC skx MC4: CPU 0: Machine Check Event: 0 Bank 255: 940000000000009f"

3. If EDAC messages can't be received, e.g., 'received 0 EDAC messages in
   total' is printed during test, there are two possible reasons:
   a. 'CONFIG_RAS_CEC=y' is set in the running kernel configuration,  you can
      work around it by adding 'ras=cec_disable' to kernel boot argument.
   b. DDR4 DIMMs work as 'near' memory when PMEM exist and work in 'MemoryMode',
      you can change 'Volatile Memory Mode' to '1LM' in BIOS to fix it.
      e.g., "EDKII->Socket Configuration->Memory Configuration->Memory Map
             ->Volatile Memory Mode <1LM>".
   Of course, the above two reasons maybe cause other RAS test cases failure.
